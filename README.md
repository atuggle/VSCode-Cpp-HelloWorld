# C++ Hello World with Debuggin using VS Code
Basic Repo for that has VS Code set up with debugging for reference.  Can be easily used as a boiler plate repo.

## Used the video tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIw02CaEusY)

## NOTES:
* This was created using my Mac, so it is specific to VSCode on a mac
* Notice the .vscode folder has been committed specifically for reference on configuring VS Code
* I used the g++ compiler already installed on my Mac
* I used <Shift><Command>P to install the following:
  * task.json <- used for compiling the code in main.cpp
  * launch.json <- used for debugging configuration

## Compile/Debug
 * To compile: <shift><command>B
 * To debug: 
    * Set break point
    * In Debug tab click the green play button (launch.json) has configured this to work.
